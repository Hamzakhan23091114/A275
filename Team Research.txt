Dependent Variable: Typically, the outcomes or variables being measured. In this dataset, the dependent variables are likely:

Prevalence of anxiety disorders among males.
Prevalence of anxiety disorders among females.

Independent Variables: Factors that might influence or correlate with the dependent variable. Here, potential independent variables include:

Year
Population
Entity (country/region, as a categorical variable)
Continent (where available)

Null Hypothesis(H₀): The prevalence of anxiety disorders remains constant over years.
Hypothesis(H₁): The prevalence of anxiety disorders changes over years.

relation and corelation:-

Here is the correlation matrix for the selected variables:

Variable Pair	                                        Correlation Coefficient
Male Anxiety Prevalence ↔ Female Anxiety Prevalence	0.9176 (Strong positive correlation)
Male Anxiety Prevalence ↔ Year	  			0.0556 (Weak positive correlation)
Female Anxiety Prevalence ↔ Year			0.0346 (Weak positive correlation)
Male Anxiety Prevalence ↔ Population	-		0.0478 (Weak negative correlation)
Female Anxiety Prevalence ↔ Population	-		0.0326 (Weak negative correlation)
Year ↔ Population					0.0147 (No significant correlation)


Research Question: Is there a significant difference in the prevalence of anxiety disorders between males and females across different countries or regions, and how does this prevalence vary 		   over time?

code start from here for the library:

library(ggplot2)
data <- read.csv("prevalence-of-anxiety-disorders-males-vs-females.csv")
colnames(data) <- c("Entity", "Code", "Year", "Male_Anxiety", "Female_Anxiety", "Population", "Continent")
clean_data <- na.omit(data[, c("Male_Anxiety", "Female_Anxiety", "Year")])
library(reshape2)
long_data <- melt(clean_data, id.vars = "Year", measure.vars = c("Male_Anxiety", "Female_Anxiety"), 
                  variable.name = "Gender", value.name = "Anxiety_Prevalence")

For Box Plot:

ggplot(long_data, aes(x = Gender, y = Anxiety_Prevalence, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Box Plot of Anxiety Prevalence by Gender",
       x = "Gender", 
       y = "Anxiety Prevalence (%)") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Male_Anxiety" = "#1f77b4", "Female_Anxiety" = "#ff7f0e"))


For Histogram:
ggplot(combined_data, aes(x = Prevalence, fill = Gender)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.7, position = "identity", bins = 30) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Anxiety Prevalence by Gender",
       x = "Anxiety Prevalence (%)", 
       y = "Frequency") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Male" = "#1f77b4", "Female" = "#ff7f0e"))
